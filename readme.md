# Real-Time Auction System

This project is a real-time auction application built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **WebSockets**. It allows multiple users to place bids on an auction in real-time, with all participants instantly receiving updates on the current highest bid and the highest bidder.

## Features

- Real-time bidding: Users can place bids, and updates are immediately broadcasted to all participants.
- WebSockets: The application leverages WebSocket technology for efficient, real-time bi-directional communication between the server and the clients.
- Simple, modern UI: The front-end provides a clean, easy-to-use interface for users to participate in the auction.
- Error handling: Users are notified when their bids are too low or invalid.
